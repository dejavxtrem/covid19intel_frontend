# Heroku link: 

# Purpose: 
Tracking COVID-19 information by country and users can leave messages in public forum regarding the pandemic, or make comments/requests

# Future goals
* Adding authentication so edit/delete functionality is restricted to only the user that posted a particular comment/request.

# Technologies used: 
mongo, mongoDB, MLab, React, React Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, Heroku for hosting.

# Approach taken: 
Set up comments functionality for add/edit/show/delete, and put in the map at the top. We then all worked on adding table for 10 countries with highest number of cases. Then the functionality for dropdown, country modals, comment edit modal and carousel got added. Then we finished styling.

# User stories:
* As a user, I can see the carousel rotate automatically or shift it manually between the world map and the CDC guidelines image.
* I can select a country from a dropdown and click GO button to view stats for that country
* I can view a table of the 10 countries with the highest number of cases
* I can add, edit, view and delete comments/requests
